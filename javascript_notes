HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web.

JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for creating dynamic and interactive content on web pages. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.


Javascript is internally linked inside the HTML file OR externally linked in a separate .js file.

Any code written in <script> </script> is JavaScript internal coding.

Practice: Just put html code into html file. Call JS file inside html file.
// source is script.js file
<script src = script.js>   </script>


JS has three variable types:
var = scope global
let  = scope local
const = scope local -- can never be changed.

create names by camel-cashing -- most preferred way
firstName

// object creation
const person
